They were however used as special meaningful gifts the earliest evidence of this were of plants inside a basket that were offered to a pagan goddess for a sacred offering. Baskets have been used over the centuries for numerous daily tasks such as carrying produce and made life easier in the past for it utilitarian purposes. Baskets now and still today are still made by hand; even through this industrial age the creation of baskets with machinery is nearly impossible.
